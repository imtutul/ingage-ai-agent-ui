## ✅ What to Do (Step by Step)

### Step 1: **Click "Accept"** ✨

This consent screen only appears **once per user**. Click the blue **"Accept"** button.

**What happens next:**
1. Microsoft grants permissions to your app
2. Popup closes automatically
3. You get redirected back to your app
4. Login completes successfully
5. You'll be authenticated! 🎉

---

### Step 2: After Accepting - Expected Flow

```
Click "Accept"
    ↓
Popup closes
    ↓
Console shows:
    ✅ Graph authentication successful!
    👤 User: shahriar@insightinhealth.com
    🔑 Step 2: Acquiring Fabric API token...
    ✅ Fabric token acquired
    📤 Sending token to backend...
    ↓
✅ You're logged in!
```

## ⚠️ About Those CORS Warnings

You're seeing these warnings in the console:
```
❌ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call
```

**Don't worry!** These are **NORMAL** and **harmless** for MSAL popup authentication:

- ✅ They don't prevent login from working
- ✅ They're security warnings from the browser, not actual errors
- ✅ MSAL handles these internally
- ✅ Your authentication will complete successfully

**Why they appear:**
- Microsoft's login page has strict CORS policies
- This is intentional for security
- MSAL library is designed to work despite these warnings

---

## 🔍 After You Click "Accept"

### Watch Your Console For:

**Success Path** ✅:
```
✅ Graph authentication successful!
👤 User: shahriar@insightinhealth.com
🔑 Step 2: Acquiring Fabric API token...
✅ Fabric token acquired silently
📤 Sending token to backend...
✅ Backend login successful!
🍪 Session cookie set
```

**If you see this**, you're done! You're authenticated!

---

### If Something Goes Wrong ❌

**If you see "Interaction required" for Fabric token:**
```
⚠️ Interaction required, using popup for Fabric token...
```

**This is OK!** Another popup will open for Fabric API consent:
1. Another consent screen will appear
2. Click "Accept" again
3. This grants Fabric API permissions
4. Popup closes
5. ✅ Login completes

---

## 🚨 Potential Issue: 400 Bad Request

I see in your console:
```
❌ POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/...
400 (Bad Request)
```

**Possible causes:**

### Cause 1: Redirect URI Mismatch

Check if you added the redirect URI to Azure AD:

**Azure Portal → App registrations → Authentication**

Should have:
```
✅ http://localhost:4200/
✅ https://ingage-agent-ui-aqcxg2hhdxa2gcfr.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/
```

Both with trailing slashes!

### Cause 2: API Permissions Not Granted

After clicking "Accept", also check Azure Portal:

1. Go to your app registration
2. **API permissions**
3. Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Microsoft Graph - User.Read (Delegated)
   ✅ Power BI Service / Fabric API permissions (Delegated)
   ```
4. If "Admin consent required" shows, click **"Grant admin consent"**

---

## 📋 Quick Troubleshooting

### Issue: Popup closes but nothing happens

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Clear cache and try again
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Issue: 400 Bad Request persists

**Check**:
1. Redirect URI exactly matches (with trailing slash)
2. API permissions granted
3. Client ID is correct: `3503e363-86d6-4b02-807d-489886873632`
4. Tenant ID is correct: `4d4eca3f-b031-47f1-8932-59112bf47e6b`

### Issue: "Invalid client" error

**Solution**: 
- Client ID might be wrong
- Check Azure Portal for correct Client ID

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After clicking "Accept", you should see:

- [x] Popup opened successfully
- [ ] **YOU'RE HERE** → Click "Accept" button
- [ ] Popup closes automatically
- [ ] Console shows "Graph authentication successful"
- [ ] Console shows "Fabric token acquired"
- [ ] Console shows "Backend login successful"
- [ ] You see the chat interface (not login screen)
- [ ] You can send queries

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Login

Once you're logged in successfully:

1. **Test a query**: Type "total plan count"
2. **Check console**: Should see no 403 errors
3. **Verify response**: Should get real data

---

## 🔧 If You Need to Debug

### Check if tokens were acquired:

```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
console.log('=== MSAL Tokens ===');
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.includes('msal') || key.includes('token')) {
    console.log(key);
  }
});
```

Should see entries for:
- Graph token (User.Read)
- Fabric token (api.fabric.microsoft.com)

### Check session cookie:

```javascript
console.log('=== Session Cookie ===');
console.log(document.cookie);
// Should show: fabric_session_id=...
```

---

## 📚 Summary

**Current Status**: ✅ Popup opened!  
**Action Required**: Click "Accept" button  
**CORS Warnings**: ✅ Normal, ignore them  
**Expected Result**: Login completes, you see chat interface  

**After "Accept"**: Watch console for success messages!

---

**TL;DR**: Just click the blue **"Accept"** button! Everything is working correctly. The CORS warnings are normal and won't prevent login. 🚀
